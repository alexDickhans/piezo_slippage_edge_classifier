# Piezo slippage Machine learning edge classifier

This is a repo that attempts to use [AIfES](https://www.ims.fraunhofer.de/en/Business-Unit/Industry/Industrial-AI/Artificial-Intelligence-for-Embedded-Systems-AIfES.html) and the [ESP32-C6 Pocket board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/22925) from sparkfun do edge machine learning
classification with peizoelectric sensors to detect material interface slippage. This is very much a WIP but more information is to come.
